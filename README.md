## How to use
-Make sure the [API_MO-SOFA](https://github.com/sofacoustics/API_MO) is in Matlab path. Then, uncomment the 11th line, so the SOFA package starts (it's necessary to do this only once).\
-Load your sound source files. It can be any kind of audio you like. As a default setting, we chose a 30 seconds slice of a song. The musical instruments were separated by [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/).\
-Set the sound source position (Azimuth and Elevation).\
-Then, run the code and get your auralized audio!
