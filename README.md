# BandMembers_position_aura
Auralization of a musical group whose members positions are defined by the user.

## How to use
Make sure the [API_MO-SOFA](https://github.com/sofacoustics/API_MO) is in Matlab path. Then, uncomment the 11th line, so the SOFA package starts (it's necessary to do this only once).\
Load your sound source files. It can be any kind of audio you like. As a default setting, we chose a 30 seconds slice of a song. The musical instruments were separated by [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/).\
Set the sound source position (Azimuth and Elevation).\
Then, run the code and get your auralized audio!
